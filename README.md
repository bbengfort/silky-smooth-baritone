=====================

A silky smooth chat client made with WebSockets and Node.js

If anyone is interested in extending this client, here are a few
things we can do to really get it going, perhaps even putting it
up on an internal server at the office for our own foo chat client.

You know, if it doesn't take away from our other tasks. 

1. Enable some sort of chat history so newly logged in users can see chats.
2. Add colorization so that we can see who's who a bit better. 
3. Ensure that no null nicknames can be added
4. Create a list of the logged in users
5. Allow some basic HTML for links etc.
